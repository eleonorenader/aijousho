THE OFFICIAL DIPLOMATS Check out new single "On God" ft. Belly https://t.co/Ob5FFAS5Q3. Deutsche Rapper bedienen sich sehr gerne der ‚ÄûDipset-Mentalit√§t". So werden meist Instrumentals, aber zum Teil auch die Rap-Passagen komplett aus dem urspr√ºnglichen Umfeld √ºbernommen. Selbst die Kleidung mancher deutschen Rapper entspricht eins zu eins dem amerikanischen Vorbild. At best they rap wrong and at worst they're hard to listen to. And Juelz doesnt even have teeth anymore. "Dipset (Santana's Town)" is a song by rapper Juelz Santana released as the first single from his debut album From Me to U.

In the long run, I'm talking 50+years, people that listen to drill (Which will probably be exctint by then) will research it.

I would nearly assume Chief Keef, Waka Flaka, or Lil Durk would hold some sort of 'Drill Godfather' position in 50 years time. What do you guys think.
